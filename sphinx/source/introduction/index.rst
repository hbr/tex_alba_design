Manifesto
============================================================

- Easy to use functional programming

- Flat learning curve: Dependent types do not appear when not needed.

- Web application out of the box



Test
====


A testlink :api:`Fmlib_parse`.




Goals for Version 1
============================================================


Mandatory goals:

- Web applications in the elm style

- Playground for experimenting with dependent types

- Compilation to intermediate representation in human readable form (see chapter
  :ref:`Intermediate Representation`)


Nice to have goals:

- Simple node applications


Not necessary:

- Universe polymorphism

- Other backends (only javascript required in order to run on the browser)
